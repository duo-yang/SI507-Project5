Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.

I am accessing the Tumblr API and gathering:
- 20 posts from NBC News Tumblr blog (http://nbcnews.tumblr.com/) that are text
  posts.
- 20 posts from NBC News Tumblr blog (http://nbcnews.tumblr.com/) that are
  photo posts.
- I'll write 3 CSV files, one for posts general information, one for text post
  specific information, and the last one for photo post specific information.
- Data in each CSV file:
    Shared among all posts: Blog Name, Post ID, Post Type, Post Date, Post URL
    Photo specific: Caption, Photo URL
    Text specific: Title, Body
- URL for the API documentations: https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2
