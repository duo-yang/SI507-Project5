They can also make a solid hamburger patty, with liquid layers of ketchup and mustard, or a hamburger substitute that’s made from vegan or raw foods.

nbcnews,9886319740,text,Taxi drivers of NYC remember 9/11,"Soon [Cliff Adler] relocated to Pier 94, where families of victims went to receive assistance in applying for death certificates, as well as other social services. More than a dozen agencies set up at the pier, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Red Cross and the Salvation Army.

Free of charge, he drove victims’ family members, Red Cross volunteers, cops – anyone who needed a ride. He estimates he took a half-dozen paid fares over two months. “I was upset like a lot of people,” Adler says. “There were a lot of people who tried to help out and I was just one of many.”  Read the rest of Adler’s story here, along with several other drivers who recall their memories from 9/11 as part of the MSNBC series Ten Years Later.",2011-09-06 19:57:00 GMT,http://nbcnews.tumblr.com/post/9886319740
